## [Introduction](#introduction)
This repository contains source code for our final project for intermediate java that focuses on Intermediate concepts, codes and exercises.

#### Course Description:
This course is a continuation of CCPRGG1L - Fundamentals of Programming. The course covers advanced topics in Java to train students in developing robust programs. Topics to be covered include recursion, regular expression, basic object-oriented principles, graphics, and multithreaded programming.

#### Course outcomes:
At the end of the course, the studend must be able to:
1. Create a program that uses recursions and regular expressions
2. Implement Object-Oriented in program design
3. Create and document application that uses a modern graphical user interface (GUI)

### 🔒 Artificial Ledger Technology Banking System 

#### Machine Problem:     

Construct a JAVA OOP program using Java Swing GUI environment for Personal New Bank Account, that the new user will Register the following information: 

| Registration Form            |                     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| First Name:                 | Middle Name:        |
| Last Name:                  | Gender:             |
| Birthdate:                  | Father Name:        |
| Mother Name:                | Contact No:         |
| Address:                    | Pin code:           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------| 
| Username:                   | Password:           |
|                             |                     |
|                             |                     |
| Initial Deposit: 500        |                     |





The program will store all the information “NewAccount.txt” for the storage of the bank account, the program has feature of Deposit, Withdraw and Balance Inquiry. The initial deposit is the constant value 500 in the registration. Account No. will start at this default value. 2024100000. – new  

#### Program Requirements  

* Secure the Username and Password 

* Set an Exception handling to avoid Errors.
